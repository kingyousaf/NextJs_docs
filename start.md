## video 2 - Hello World

### To get started with building NextJs applications we need some pre-requisites

- Have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
- Have [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed
- Have a text editor, [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

#### Now to actually build a NextJs application

So we need to follow these steps in order to build a application

- Open up VsCode
- Open up an empty folder inside of it 
- Open up the intergrated terminal
- Run the command 
```bash 
yarn create next-app ./ 
```
After downloading it run 
```bash
yarn dev
```
To run it on a developemnt server over at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

### Now you all set up lets get to coding
